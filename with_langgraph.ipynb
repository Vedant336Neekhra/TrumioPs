            "2 decades!!! My 20 years career with IIT Bombay have been very happening. Thanks to my institute Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay and my Department, Energy Sceince and Engineering for all the support. It is one of the best institutes in the country in terms of work culture.   When I joined 20 years back, I realised that there are no books in India, by Indian authors in the field of #solar. Today, three of my #books are used as textbooks. Almost every Indian and some abroad who studies solar PV uses my books.   When I joined IITB there was no big research centre on solar energy in India. Today, we have established one of the largest research centres called the National Centre for Photovoltaics #Research and Education (NCPRE). I wrote over 100 reserach papers. Also developed, several courses and recorded in video form. Conducted many short term coruses on solar for industry, reserachers and enterpreners. We also developed low cost solar lab where students can easily experiment related to solar.   When I joined, everybody wanted to pilot in solar, there was no large skill development project. We started India’s largest project titled Solar Urja through Localisation (#SoULS), trained 10,000 rural women and reached out to 7.5 million households. Based on this work, we won IEEE global grand prize of US$100,000 (about Rs. 80 Lakh).   When I joined. I wanted to start a school near my village. Today there is a 14 acre #school campus in MP, that is 100% solar powered without any grid connection.   Today, I am on an 11 years #EnergySwaraj Yatra to bring mass awareness about #climatechange and corrective action, impacting millions of people.   Someone shared that when they asked #ChatGpt, who is “Solar Man of India”, responded with my name and highlights of my work.   Today I feel 20 years have been spent well. Hope next 20 years will be 1000 times more effective :-)    Hope we would create a big movement on #ActionForClimateCorrection through Energy Independence or #EnergySwaraj.   Thanks everyone for your wishes and positively supporting the work. Energy Swaraj Foundation #Education #SolarEnergy\n",

            "Solar energy! an upgrade towards digital education in Rural Schools. Over the years, the government has been actively pursuing initiatives to enhance school facilities. This has resulted in significant improvements in areas such as drinking water, midday meals, sanitation, electricity, and more. Despite commendable progress, achieving equitable distribution of educational resources remains a challenge. A recent survey and analysis of ASER 2022 across different Indian states underscore the need for sustainable infrastructure in many schools.  Not only do some schools lack electricity connections, but often those that do experience unreliable electricity. This points towards the need for sustained efforts to bridge these gaps in educational resources. As per the ASER 2022 report, the status of electricity facilities in rural regions across states reveals: Some schools did not have a proper electricity supply on the day of the survey. In Haryana, for instance, 98.8% of surveyed schools were equipped with electricity connections in 2022, but 86.3% had operational electricity during the visit. This trend is consistent in Jharkhand, where 92.4% of schools had electricity connections, yet 73.1% had electricity on the day of evaluation. Similarly, in Jammu and Kashmir, 88.9% of schools had electricity connections, but the operational rate on the visit day stood at 83.5%. The pattern persists across states such as Karnataka (97.8% with connections, 90.6% operational), and Madhya Pradesh (85.1% with connections, 73.1% operational), and is reflective of the broader scenario in other states.  Integration of solar power enabled classrooms stands as a visionary and practical solution to address the persistent infrastructural challenges hindering effective digital teaching and learning in schools. This innovative approach not only ensures uninterrupted access to education technology but also aligns with the ethos of corporates, NGOs, foundations and other ecosystem partners committed to Climate awareness and action. Amplify the impact of your social sector education initiative over the long term by fostering a culture of technological advancement, environmental responsibility, and societal progress with solar power enabled classrooms. Let's Join hands with GREEN INDIA INITIATIVE PRIVATE LIMITED & The Solar Man of India Sachin Shigwan to illuminate the futures of aspirational students in Rural India. www.giipl.in www.thesolarman.co.in #gosolar #schoolsonsolar #ruraldevelopment #CSR #HR #socialengineering #solarenergy #climate #environment #SDG #sustainability #india #schools #ruralschools\n",

            "Bill Gates (born October 28, 1955, Seattle, Washington, U.S.) is an American computer programmer and entrepreneur who cofounded Microsoft Corporation, the world’s largest personal-computer software company.\n",
            "Gates wrote his first software program at the age of 13. In high school he helped form a group of programmers who computerized their school’s payroll system and founded Traf-O-Data, a company that sold traffic-counting systems to local governments. In 1975 Gates, then a sophomore at Harvard University, joined his hometown friend Paul G. Allen to develop software for the first microcomputers. They began by adapting BASIC, a popular programming language used on large computers, for use on microcomputers. With the success of this project, Gates left Harvard during his junior year and, with Allen, formed Microsoft. Gates’s sway over the infant microcomputer industry greatly increased when Microsoft licensed an operating system called MS-DOS to International Business Machines Corporation—then the world’s biggest computer supplier and industry pacesetter—for use on its first microcomputer, the IBM PC (personal computer). After the machine’s release in 1981, IBM quickly set the technical standard for the PC industry, and MS-DOS likewise pushed out competing operating systems. While Microsoft’s independence strained relations with IBM, Gates deftly manipulated the larger company so that it became permanently dependent on him for crucial software. Makers of IBM-compatible PCs, or clones, also turned to Microsoft for their basic software. By the start of the 1990s he had become the PC industry’s ultimate kingmaker.\n",
            "Largely on the strength of Microsoft’s success, Gates amassed a huge paper fortune as the company’s largest individual shareholder. He became a paper billionaire in 1986, and within a decade his net worth had reached into the tens of billions of dollars—making him by some estimates the world’s richest private individual. With few interests beyond software and the potential of information technology, Gates at first preferred to stay out of the public eye, handling civic and philanthropic affairs indirectly through one of his foundations. Nevertheless, as Microsoft’s power and reputation grew, and especially as it attracted the attention of the U.S. Justice Department’s antitrust division, Gates, with some reluctance, became a more public figure. Rivals (particularly in competing companies in Silicon Valley) portrayed him as driven, duplicitous, and determined to profit from virtually every electronic transaction in the world. His supporters, on the other hand, celebrated his uncanny business acumen, his flexibility, and his boundless appetite for finding new ways to make computers and electronics more useful through software.\n",
            "All of these qualities were evident in Gates’s nimble response to the sudden public interest in the Internet. Beginning in 1995 and 1996, Gates feverishly refocused Microsoft on the development of consumer and enterprise software solutions for the Internet, developed the Windows CE operating system platform for networking noncomputer devices such as home televisions and personal digital assistants, created the Microsoft Network to compete with America Online and other Internet providers, and, through Gates’s company Corbis, acquired the huge Bettmann photo archives and other collections for use in electronic distribution.\n",
            "In addition to his work at Microsoft, Gates was also known for his charitable work. With his then wife, Melinda, he launched the William H. Gates Foundation (renamed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 1999) in 1994 to fund global health programs as well as projects in the Pacific Northwest. During the latter part of the 1990s, the couple also funded North American libraries through the Gates Library Foundation (renamed Gates Learning Foundation in 1999) and raised money for minority study grants through the Gates Millennium Scholars program. In June 2006 Warren Buffett announced an ongoing gift to the foundation, which would allow its assets to total roughly $60 billion in the next 20 years. At the beginning of the 21st century, the foundation continued to focus on global health and global development, as well as community and education causes in the United States. After a short transition period, Gates relinquished day-to-day oversight of Microsoft in June 2008—although he remained chairman of the board—in order to devote more time to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In February 2014 he stepped down as chairman but continued to serve as a board member until 2020. During this time he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2016). The documentary series Inside Bill’s Brain: Decoding Bill Gates appeared in 2019. Two years later Gates and his wife divorced.\n",
            "It remains to be seen whether Gates’s extraordinary success will guarantee him a lasting place in the pantheon of great Americans. At the very least, historians seem likely to view him as a business figure as important to computers as John D. Rockefeller was to oil. Gates himself displayed an acute awareness of the perils of prosperity in his 1995 best seller, The Road Ahead, where he observed, “Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose.”\n",

Gates led the company as its chairman and chief executive officer until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board of directors and became chief software architect. During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which were considered anti-competitive.\n",
            "In June 2008, Gates transitioned into a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation he and his then-wife Melinda had established in 2000. He stepped down as chairman of the Microsoft board in February 2014 and assumed the role of technology adviser to support newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella. In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic efforts on climate change, global health and development, and education.\n",
            "Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's top billionaires. From 1995 to 2017, he held the title of the wealthiest person in the world every year except in 2008 and from 2010 to 2013. In 1999, he became the first ever centibillionaire when his net worth briefly surpassed US$100 billion. Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates has pursued other business and philanthropic endeavors.\n",
            "He is the founder and chairman of several companies, including BEN, Cascade Investment, TerraPower, Gates Ventures, and Breakthrough Energy. He has donated to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, reported to be the world's largest private charity. Through the foundation, he led an early 21st century vaccination campaign that significantly contributed to the eradication of the wild poliovirus in Africa. In 2010, Gates and Warren Buffett founded the Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth towards philanthropy.\n",
            "Early life and education\n",
            "William Henry Gates III was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington[3] as the only son of William H. Gates Sr.[lower-alpha 2] (1925–2020) and his first wife, Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994).[4] His ancestry includes English, German, and Irish/Scots-Irish.[5] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors of First Interstate BancSystem and United Way of America. Gates's maternal grandfather J. W. Maxwell was a national bank president. He also has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or \"Trey\" (i.e., three) because his father had the \"II\" suffix.[6][7] The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was 7.[8]\n",
            "When Gates was young his parents wanted him to pursue a career in law.[9] During his childhood, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[10][11][12] Gates was small for his age and was bullied as a child.[7] The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that \"it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock; there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing\".[13]\n",
            "\n",
            "Gates (right) with Paul Allen seated at Teletype Model 33 ASR terminals in Lakeside School, 1970\n",
            "At age 13, he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep school,[14][15] where he wrote his first software program.[16] When he was in eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the students.[17] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and he was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly.[18] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, Gates and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) which banned Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent Evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.[19][7]\n",
            "The four students formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money.[7] At the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than using the system remotely via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970 when the company went out of business. The following year, a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to automate the school's class-scheduling system, providing them computer time and royalties in return. The duo worked diligently in order to have the program ready for their senior year. Towards the end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident, which Gates described as one of the saddest days of his life. He then turned to Allen who helped him finish the system for Lakeside.[7]\n",
            "At 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen called Traf-O-Data to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[20] In 1972, he served as a congressional page in the House of Representatives.[21][22] He was a national merit scholar when he graduated from Lakeside School in 1973.[23] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[24][25] He did not stay at Harvard long enough to choose a concentration, but took mathematics (including Math 55) and graduate level computer science courses.[26] While at Harvard, he met fellow student and future Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer stayed and graduated magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO and maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation in 2014.[27][28]\n",
            "Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[29] presented in a combinatorics class by professor Harry Lewis. His solution held the record as the fastest version for over 30 years, and its successor is faster by only 2%.[29][30] His solution was formalized and published in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[31]\n",
            "Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen and joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[32] In 1975, the MITS Altair 8800 was released based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[33] Gates dropped out of Harvard that same year. His parents were supportive of him after seeing how much he wanted to start his own company.[34] He explained his decision to leave Harvard: \"if things hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on leave.\"[35]\n",

            "Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics which demonstrated the Altair 8800, and contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[36] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. MITS hired Allen,[37] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their partnership \"Micro-Soft\", a combination of \"microcomputer\" and \"software\", and their first office was in Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator Ric Weiland.[37] They dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name \"Microsoft\" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976.[37] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.\n",
            "Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked out and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, he wrote An Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and the Altair \"hobby market\" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.[38] This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.[37] The company moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue, Washington on January 1, 1979.[36]\n",

As the company grew, he transitioned into a manager role, then an executive.[39] DONKEY.BAS, is a computer game written in 1981 and included with early versions of the PC DOS operating system distributed with the original IBM PC. It is a driving game in which the player must avoid hitting donkeys. The game was written by Gates and Neil Konzen.[40][41]\n",
            "IBM partnership\n",
            "IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, approached Microsoft in July 1980 concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC,[42] after Gates's mother mentioned Microsoft to John Opel, IBM's then CEO.[43] IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. IBM's representatives also mentioned that they needed an operating system, and Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.[44] IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft could provide an operating system. A few weeks later, Gates and Allen proposed using 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC.[45] Microsoft made a deal with SCP to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, and later the full owner. Microsoft employed Paterson to adapt the operating system for the PC[46] and delivered it to IBM as PC DOS for a one-time fee of $50,000.[47]\n",
            "The contract itself only earned Microsoft a relatively small fee. It was the prestige brought to Microsoft by IBM's adoption of their operating system that would be the origin of Microsoft's transformation from a small business to the leading software company in the world. Gates had not offered to transfer the copyright on the operating system to IBM because he believed that other personal computer makers would clone IBM's PC hardware.[47] They did, making the IBM-compatible PC, running DOS, a de facto standard. The sales of MS-DOS (the version of DOS sold to customers other than IBM) made Microsoft a major player in the industry.[48] The press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the IBM PC. PC Magazine asked if Gates was \"the man behind the machine?\".[42]\n",
            "Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president and chairman of the board, with Paul Allen as vice president and vice chairman. In early 1983, Allen left the company after receiving a Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, effectively ending the formal business partnership between Gates and Allen, which had been strained months prior due to a contentious dispute over Microsoft equity.[36][49] Later in the decade, Gates repaired his relationship with Allen and together the two donated millions to their childhood school Lakeside.[7] They remained friends until Allen's death in October 2018.[50]\n",
            "Windows\n",
            "Microsoft and Gates launched their first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985, in an attempt to fend off competition from Apple's Macintosh GUI, which had captivated consumers with its simplicity and ease of use.[51] In August 1986, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences.[52] The operating system grew out of DOS in an organic fashion over a decade until Windows 95, which hid the DOS prompt by default. Windows XP was released one year after Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO.[53] Windows 8.1 was the last version of the OS released before Gates left the chair of the firm to John W. Thompson on February 5, 2014.[54]\n",

He has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100,[55] but he wrote code that shipped with the company's products as late as 1989.[56] Jerry Pournelle wrote in 1985 when Gates announced Microsoft Excel: \"Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack.\"[57] During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which were considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.[58]\n",

He gradually divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.[59] The process took two years to fully transfer his duties to Ozzie and Mundie, and was completed on June 27, 2008.[60]\n",

In the interview, he provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: \"there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism.\" Gates also identified innovation as the \"real driver of progress\" and pronounced that \"America's way better today than it's ever been.\"[63] Gates has often expressed concern about the potential harms of superintelligence; in a Reddit \"ask me anything\", he stated that:\n",

Wyoming Senator John Barrasso also said that it could boost the state's once-active uranium mining industry.[117]\n",
            "Gates spent many efforts to make pass the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 because of his importance to climate. He tried to convince Joe Manchin to support a climate bill from the year 2019 and especially in the months before the adoption of the bill. The bill should cut the global greenhouse gas emissions in a level similar to \"eliminating the annual planet-warming pollution of France and Germany combined\" and may help to limit the warming of the planet to 1.5 degrees – the target of the Paris Agreement.[118] He thanked both Joe Manchin and Chuck Schumer for their efforts in a guest essay in The New York Times, where he said \"Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 may be the single most important piece of climate legislation in American history\" given its potential to spur development of new technologies.[119] Gates gave further insights on climate change in his commencement address at Northern Arizona University on May 6, 2023, where he was bestowed an honorary doctorate.[120]\n",

He warned that it would cause \"polarization\" if users with different political views divide up among various social networks, and said: \"I don't think banning somebody who actually did get a fair number of votes (in the presidential election) – well less than a majority – but I don't think having him off forever would be that good.\"[121]\n",

            "In April 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gates was criticized for suggesting that pharmaceutical companies should hold onto patents for COVID-19 vaccines. The criticism came due to the possibility of this preventing poorer nations from obtaining adequate vaccines. Tara Van Ho of the University of Essex stated, \"Gates speaks as if all the lives being lost in India are inevitable but eventually the West will help when in reality the US & UK are holding their feet on the neck of developing states by refusing to break [intellectual property rights] protections. It's disgusting.\"[123]\n",

It grants funds to learning institutes and libraries and supports scholarships at universities. The foundation established a water, sanitation and hygiene program to provide sustainable sanitation services in poor countries.[136] Its agriculture division supports the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat vitamin A deficiency.[137] The foundation aims to provide women and girls in the developing world with information and support regarding contraception and, ultimately, universal access to consensual family planning.[138] In 2007, the Los Angeles Times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, pollution and pharmaceutical firms that do not sell to developing countries.[139] Although the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility,[140] it was subsequently canceled and upheld its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[141]\n",

His image morphed from \"tyrannical technocrat to saintly savior\" to a \"huggable billionaire techno-philanthropist\", celebrated on magazine covers and sought after for his opinions on major issues like global health and climate change.[199] Still another shift in public opinion came in 2021 with the announcement that he and Melinda were divorcing. Coverage of that proceeding brought out information about romantic pursuits of women who worked for him, a long-term extra-marital affair, and a friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.[200] This information and his response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in some deterioration of his public image, going from \"a lovable nerd who was out to save the world\" to \"a tech supervillain who wants to protect profits over public health.\"[201]\n",

I mean, it's at least a moral belief.\"[208] In the same 2014 interview he also said: \"I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about.

In May 2006, Gates remarked that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world, because he disliked the attention that it brought.[213] In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person after Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.[214][215] Slim regained the position again in June 2014[216][217] (but then lost the top position back to Gates).

            "During his tenure as CEO of Microsoft, Gates approved of many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices. In the 1998 United States v. Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as \"compete\", \"concerned\", and \"we\".

            "Gates had primary responsibility for Microsoft's product strategy from the company's founding in 1975 until 2006. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; an industry executive complained in 1981 that \"Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.\"[229] An Atari executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times. When they met again a month later, Gates \"won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor\".[230]\n",
            "In the early 1980s, while business partner Paul Allen was undergoing treatments for cancer, Gates — according to Allen — conspired to reduce the latter's share in Microsoft by issuing himself stock options.[231][232][233] In his autobiography, Allen would later recall that Gates was \"scheming to rip me off. It was mercenary opportunism plain and simple\".[231] Gates says he remembers the episode differently.[232] Allen would also recall that Gates was prone to shouting episodes.[233]\n",
            "Gates has often been accused of bullying Microsoft employees.[234] He met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers, and the managers described him as being verbally combative, berating them for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.[235][236] Gates saw competition in personal terms; when Borland's Turbo Pascal performed better than Microsoft's own tools, he yelled at programming director Greg Whitten \"for half an hour\" because, Gates believed, Borland's Philippe Kahn had surpassed Gates.[237] Gates interrupted presentations with such comments as \"that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard\"[238] and \"why don't you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?\"[239] The target of his outburst would then have to defend the proposal in detail until Gates was fully convinced.[238] Not all harsh language was criticism; a manager recalled that \"You're full of shit. That's the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard\" meant that Gates was amazed. \"In the lore of Microsoft, if Bill says that to you, you're made\".[240] When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, \"I'll do it over the weekend\".[241][56][242]\n",
            "Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein\n",
            "A 2019 New York Times article reported that Gates's relationship with financier Jeffrey Epstein started in 2011, just a few years after Epstein was convicted for procuring a child for prostitution, and continued for some years, including a visit to Epstein's house with his wife in the fall of 2013, despite her declared discomfort.[243] Gates said in 2011 about Epstein: \"His lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me\".[200]\n",
            "The depth of the friendship between Gates and Epstein is unclear though Gates generally commented that \"I met him. I didn't have any business relationship or friendship with him\".[244] However, Gates visited Epstein \"many times, despite [Epstein's] past\".[243] It was reported that Epstein and Gates \"discussed the Gates Foundation and philanthropy\".[243] However, in an interview in 2019 Gates completely denied any connection between Epstein and the Gates Foundation or his philanthropy generally.[244] In August 2021, Gates said the reason he had meetings with Epstein was because Gates hoped Epstein could provide money for philanthropic work, though nothing came of the idea. Gates added, \"It was a huge mistake to spend time with him, to give him the credibility of being there.\"[234] Gates came under further scrutiny after it was revealed that he had travelled on Epstein's private jet, though further claims about Gates travelling to Little St James proved unsubstantiated.[245]\n",
            "It has also been reported that Epstein and Gates met with Nobel Committee chair Thorbjørn Jagland at his residence in Strasbourg, France in March 2013 to discuss the Nobel Prize.[246] Also in attendance were representatives of the International Peace Institute which has received millions in grants from the Gates Foundation, including a $2.5 million \"community engagement\" grant in October 2013.[247] In 2023, it was reported that Epstein threatened to expose an alleged affair Gates had with a Russian bridge player.[248]\n",

            "Bill Gates is one of the most iconic business leaders and influential technology pioneers of the modern digital era. As the co-founder of Microsoft, he helped bring the power of personal computing to millions of people worldwide and made computers an indispensable part of everyday life. This article explores Gates‘ upbringing, the growth of Microsoft, his philanthropic endeavors, and his lasting impact on technology and society.\n",
            "Early Life: Shaping One of the Great Minds in Tech\n",
            "Born on October 28, 1955 in Seattle, Washington, Gates‘ showed an early interest in computers. His parents William H. Gates Sr. and Mary Maxwell Gates created a competitive, encouraging environment. His father was a prominent lawyer while his mother served on various corporate boards. She helped choose the lakeside school Gates attended, which had access to computers in 1968, still a rarity at the time.\n",
            "During 8th grade in lakeside, the Mothers Club donated $3,000 to purchase computer time for students. Gates and his fellow students, including Paul Allen who became Microsoft‘s co-founder, got hooked to programming. At 13, Gates even created a software program for scheduling classes and testing schedules for students.\n",
            "Growing up among Seattle‘s blossoming tech scene, dominated by companies like Boeing, shaped Gates‘ ambition. He gained a reputation as the math and science whiz kid. Outside of computers, he also enjoyed sports like water skiing.\n",
            "Gates‘ parents supported his interests, like his mother helping him get computer time from local companies. This early exposure instilled in Gates a belief that computers could change the world.\n",
            "Dropping Out Of College To Pursue His Vision\n",
            "In 1973, Gates enrolled at Harvard University, originally thinking he would follow his lawyer father‘s footsteps. But he remained more drawn to computing and skipped classes to spend time at the computer lab.\n",
            "Then in late 1974, Popular Electronics magazine featured the MITS Altair 8800, considered the first personal computer that hobbyists could build at home. Gates immediately knew he and Allen could develop software for it. He called MITS and claimed he was working on a BASIC software program, convincing them to give him a chance. Gates and Allen then vigorously developed the interpreter in a few weeks, created a company called Micro-Soft, and licensed their software to run on MITS‘ hardware.\n",
            "This success convinced Gates to leave Harvard in 1975 and join Allen in New Mexico where MITS was based. They relocated Micro-Soft to Bellevue, Washington the same year. Their first office had only three employees including Gates doing both software development and business management.\n",
            "Gates oversaw the completion of software programming languages for various systems while handling Microsoft‘s business details. He proved to be a tough negotiator in licensing Microsoft‘s products even at this early stage.\n",
            "By 1979, Microsoft had grossed over $2.5 million. But Gates still had even bigger ambitions.\n",
            "Deal With IBM And Rise Of Microsoft\n",
            "In 1980, IBM approached Microsoft since they needed an operating system for their upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC. Microsoft didn‘t have one but negotiated a deal to license them an operating system called 86-DOS owned by Seattle Computer Products. Microsoft adapted 86-DOS to create PC-DOS and later MS-DOS, designing it for any hardware so non-IBM computers could also use it.\n",
            "This flexible licensing model was the opposite of IBM‘s restrictive approach and the key to Microsoft‘s future dominance. It paved the way for Gates to license MS-DOS to any computer manufacturer, enabling incredible growth for Microsoft. By 1987, one third of the world‘s computers were running Microsoft software.\n",
            "Capitalizing on increasing user-friendliness of graphical interfaces, Gates spearheaded the development of the Windows operating system. Though initially just an add-on to DOS, Windows paired the GUI with multitasking capabilities. The first Windows release came in 1985 but it was the 1990s release of Windows 95 that truly propelled Microsoft into a household name.\n",
            "Leveraging the success of Windows, Microsoft also created applications like Word, Excel and PowerPoint as part of the Office productivity suite. By the early 1990s, Microsoft controlled 90% of the operating systems market and over 50% of the office suite applications market. Annual revenues soared from around $1 million in Microsoft‘s early days to $8 billion by 1994.\n",
            "Leadership And Management Of Tech Juggernaut\n",
            "Gates exhibited a driven, competitive spirit and intense work ethic as he built Microsoft. He became President in 1983 and CEO in 1986, remaining in that role until 2000.\n",
            "Known for his sharp, intensely focused mind, Gates was respected and feared within Microsoft. He could be confrontational and blunt, grilling employees in meetings to force out original ideas. Gates looked for self-directed workers who shared his competitiveness. He was deeply involved in technical elements of product development, reviewing every line of code.\n",
            "But he could also adapt based on feedback, like when colleagues convinced him to take a less combative approach to working with external partners. Under Gates‘ leadership, Microsoft captured 95% of the operating systems market share. But it drew scrutiny for monopolistic practices that Gates fiercely defended.\n",
            "Gates mentored and elevated talented leaders including Steve Ballmer who eventually succeeded him as CEO in 2000, while Gates took the role of Chief Software Architect. He officially stepped down as Chairman in 2014, but remained a board member and technology advisor focused on product development until 2020.\n",
            "Wealth Beyond Imagination And Turn To Philanthropy\n",
            "Microsoft‘s astronomical success made Gates a billionaire by age 31. At one point in the late 1990s, his net worth exceeded $100 billion. He topped the Forbes richest people list for over a decade.\n",
            "But he grew interested in how software could tackle inequity. After reading about rotavirus killing children in developing countries in 1997, Gates channeled more energy into philanthropy. In 2000, he stepped down from his day-to-day role at Microsoft and co-founded the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation alongside his wife, ex-Microsoft executive Melinda French.\n",
            "The foundation quickly became the world‘s largest transparent private foundation. With Melinda, Gates pioneered a new hands-on model for philanthropic engagement, strategically investing their wealth in global health, poverty reduction, education and other causes.\n",
            "Some highlight initiatives include:\n",
            "To date, Gates has donated $45.5 billion to the foundation. He also joined The Giving Pledge, vowing to give away most of his fortune.\n",
            "Accolades And Continued Impact\n",
            "Among other honors, Gates received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 and an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in 2005.\n",
            "He has authored two books focusing on technology‘s role in business and society – The Road Ahead (1995) and Business @ The Speed Of Thought (1999). More recently in 2021, he published How To Avoid A Climate Disaster, supporting policies to eliminate greenhouse gases and investing $1 billion into climate change solutions through his foundation.\n",
            "After retiring from day-to-day Microsoft involvement, Gates continues to shape technology and philanthropy. Though Bill and Melinda announced their divorce in 2021, they plan to co-lead the foundation. Gates also regularly participates in ask-me-anything forums on Reddit where users pose wide-ranging questions for him to answer.\n",
            "Through his visionary leadership and generosity, Bill Gates embodies both the amazing potential and responsibilities of technology pioneers to change the world.\n",

            "Bill Gates (born October 28, 1955, Seattle, Washington, U.S.) is an American computer programmer and entrepreneur who cofounded Microsoft Corporation, the world’s largest personal-computer software company.\n",
            "Gates wrote his first software program at the age of 13. In high school he helped form a group of programmers who computerized their school’s payroll system and founded Traf-O-Data, a company that sold traffic-counting systems to local governments. In 1975 Gates, then a sophomore at Harvard University, joined his hometown friend Paul G. Allen to develop software for the first microcomputers. They began by adapting BASIC, a popular programming language used on large computers, for use on microcomputers. With the success of this project, Gates left Harvard during his junior year and, with Allen, formed Microsoft. Gates’s sway over the infant microcomputer industry greatly increased when Microsoft licensed an operating system called MS-DOS to International Business Machines Corporation—then the world’s biggest computer supplier and industry pacesetter—for use on its first microcomputer, the IBM PC (personal computer). After the machine’s release in 1981, IBM quickly set the technical standard for the PC industry, and MS-DOS likewise pushed out competing operating systems. While Microsoft’s independence strained relations with IBM, Gates deftly manipulated the larger company so that it became permanently dependent on him for crucial software. Makers of IBM-compatible PCs, or clones, also turned to Microsoft for their basic software. By the start of the 1990s he had become the PC industry’s ultimate kingmaker.\n",
            "Largely on the strength of Microsoft’s success, Gates amassed a huge paper fortune as the company’s largest individual shareholder. He became a paper billionaire in 1986, and within a decade his net worth had reached into the tens of billions of dollars—making him by some estimates the world’s richest private individual. With few interests beyond software and the potential of information technology, Gates at first preferred to stay out of the public eye, handling civic and philanthropic affairs indirectly through one of his foundations. Nevertheless, as Microsoft’s power and reputation grew, and especially as it attracted the attention of the U.S. Justice Department’s antitrust division, Gates, with some reluctance, became a more public figure. Rivals (particularly in competing companies in Silicon Valley) portrayed him as driven, duplicitous, and determined to profit from virtually every electronic transaction in the world. His supporters, on the other hand, celebrated his uncanny business acumen, his flexibility, and his boundless appetite for finding new ways to make computers and electronics more useful through software.\n",
            "All of these qualities were evident in Gates’s nimble response to the sudden public interest in the Internet. Beginning in 1995 and 1996, Gates feverishly refocused Microsoft on the development of consumer and enterprise software solutions for the Internet, developed the Windows CE operating system platform for networking noncomputer devices such as home televisions and personal digital assistants, created the Microsoft Network to compete with America Online and other Internet providers, and, through Gates’s company Corbis, acquired the huge Bettmann photo archives and other collections for use in electronic distribution.\n",
            "In addition to his work at Microsoft, Gates was also known for his charitable work. With his then wife, Melinda, he launched the William H. Gates Foundation (renamed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 1999) in 1994 to fund global health programs as well as projects in the Pacific Northwest. During the latter part of the 1990s, the couple also funded North American libraries through the Gates Library Foundation (renamed Gates Learning Foundation in 1999) and raised money for minority study grants through the Gates Millennium Scholars program. In June 2006 Warren Buffett announced an ongoing gift to the foundation, which would allow its assets to total roughly $60 billion in the next 20 years. At the beginning of the 21st century, the foundation continued to focus on global health and global development, as well as community and education causes in the United States. After a short transition period, Gates relinquished day-to-day oversight of Microsoft in June 2008—although he remained chairman of the board—in order to devote more time to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In February 2014 he stepped down as chairman but continued to serve as a board member until 2020. During this time he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2016). The documentary series Inside Bill’s Brain: Decoding Bill Gates appeared in 2019. Two years later Gates and his wife divorced.\n",
            "It remains to be seen whether Gates’s extraordinary success will guarantee him a lasting place in the pantheon of great Americans. At the very least, historians seem likely to view him as a business figure as important to computers as John D. Rockefeller was to oil. Gates himself displayed an acute awareness of the perils of prosperity in his 1995 best seller, The Road Ahead, where he observed, “Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose.”\n",

            "Entrepreneur Bill Gates founded the world's largest software business, Microsoft, with Paul Allen, and subsequently became one of the richest men in the world.\n",
            "(1955-)\n",
            "Who Is Bill Gates?\n",
            "Entrepreneur and businessman Bill Gates and his business partner Paul Allen founded and built the world's largest software business, Microsoft, through technological innovation, keen business strategy and aggressive business tactics. In the process, Gates became one of the richest men in the world. In February 2014, Gates announced that he was stepping down as Microsoft's chairman to focus on charitable work at his foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n",
            "Early Life\n",
            "Gates was born William Henry Gates III on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. Gates grew up in an upper-middle-class family with his older sister, Kristianne, and younger sister, Libby. Their father, William H. Gates Sr., was a promising, if somewhat shy, law student when he met his future wife, Mary Maxwell. She was an athletic, outgoing student at the University of Washington, actively involved in student affairs and leadership.\n",
            "The Gates family atmosphere was warm and close, and all three children were encouraged to be competitive and strive for excellence. Gates showed early signs of competitiveness when he coordinated family athletic games at their summer house on Puget Sound. He also relished in playing board games (Risk was his favorite) and excelled at Monopoly.\n",
            "Gates had a very close relationship with his mother, Mary, who after a brief career as a teacher devoted her time to helping raise the children and working on civic affairs and with charities. She also served on several corporate boards, including those of the First Interstate Bank in Seattle (founded by her grandfather), the United Way and International Business Machines (IBM). She would often take Gates along when she volunteered in schools and at community organizations.\n",
            "Education\n",
            "Gates was a voracious reader as a child, spending many hours poring over reference books such as the encyclopedia. Around the age of 11 or 12, Gates's parents began to have concerns about his behavior. He was doing well in school, but he seemed bored and withdrawn at times, and his parents worried he might become a loner.\n",
            "Though they were strong believers in public education, when Gates turned 13, his parents enrolled him at Seattle's exclusive preparatory Lakeside School. He blossomed in nearly all his subjects, excelling in math and science, but also doing very well in drama and English.\n",
            "While at Lakeside School, a Seattle computer company offered to provide computer time for the students. The Mother's Club used proceeds from the school's rummage sale to purchase a teletype terminal for students to use. Gates became entranced with what a computer could do and spent much of his free time working on the terminal. He wrote a tic-tac-toe program in BASIC computer language that allowed users to play against the computer.\n",
            "Gates graduated from Lakeside in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the college SAT test, a feat of intellectual achievement that he boasted about for several years when introducing himself to new people.\n",

            "Harvard Dropout\n",
            "Gates enrolled at Harvard University in the fall of 1973, originally thinking of a career in law. Much to his parents' dismay, Gates dropped out of college in 1975 to pursue his business, Microsoft, with partner Allen.\n",
            "Gates spent more of his time in the computer lab than in class. He did not really have a study regimen; he got by on a few hours of sleep, crammed for a test, and passed with a reasonable grade.\n",
            "Meeting and Partnering With Paul Allen\n",
            "Gates met Allen, who was two years his senior, in high school at Lakeside School. The pair became fast friends, bonding over their common enthusiasm for computers, even though they were very different people. Allen was more reserved and shy. Gates was feisty and at times combative.\n",
            "Regardless of their differences, Allen and Gates spent much of their free time together working on programs. Occasionally, the two disagreed and would clash over who was right or who should run the computer lab. On one occasion, their argument escalated to the point where Allen banned Gates from the computer lab.\n",
            "At one point, Gates and Allen had their school computer privileges revoked for taking advantage of software glitches to obtain free computer time from the company that provided the computers. After their probation, they were allowed back in the computer lab when they offered to debug the program. During this time, Gates developed a payroll program for the computer company the boys had hacked into and a scheduling program for the school.\n",
            "In 1970, at the age of 15, Gates and Allen went into business together, developing \"Traf-o-Data,\" a computer program that monitored traffic patterns in Seattle. They netted $20,000 for their efforts. Gates and Allen wanted to start their own company, but Gates' parents wanted him to finish school and go on to college, where they hoped he would work to become a lawyer.\n",
            "Allen went to Washington State University, while Gates went to Harvard, though the pair stayed in touch. After attending college for two years, Allen dropped out and moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to work for Honeywell. Around this time, he showed Gates an edition of Popular Electronics magazine featuring an article on the Altair 8800 mini-computer kit. Both young men were fascinated with the possibilities of what this computer could create in the world of personal computing.\n",
            "The Altair was made by a small company in Albuquerque, New Mexico, called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS). Gates and Allen contacted the company, proclaiming that they were working on a BASIC software program that would run the Altair computer. In reality, they didn't have an Altair to work with or the code to run it, but they wanted to know if MITS was interested in someone developing such software.\n",
            "MITS was, and its president, Ed Roberts, asked the boys for a demonstration. Gates and Allen scrambled, spending the next two months writing the BASIC software at Harvard's computer lab. Allen traveled to Albuquerque for a test run at MITS, never having tried it out on an Altair computer. It worked perfectly. Allen was hired at MITS, and Gates soon left Harvard to work with him. Together they founded Microsoft.\n",
            "Allen remained with Microsoft until 1983, when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. Though his cancer went into remission a year later with intensive treatment, Allen resigned from the company. Rumors abound as to why Allen left Microsoft. Some say Gates pushed him out, but many say it was a life-changing experience for Allen and he saw there were other opportunities that he could invest his time in.\n",
            "Founding Microsoft\n",
            "In 1975, Gates and Allen formed Micro-Soft, a blend of \"micro-computer\" and \"software\" (they dropped the hyphen within a year). The company's first product was BASIC software that ran on the Altair computer.\n",
            "At first, all was not smooth sailing. Although Microsoft’s BASIC software program for the Altair computer netted the company a fee and royalties, it wasn't meeting their overhead. According to Gates' later account, only about 10 percent of the people using BASIC in the Altair computer had actually paid for it.\n",
            "Microsoft's BASIC software was popular with computer hobbyists, who obtained pre-market copies and were reproducing and distributing them for free. At this time, many personal computer enthusiasts were not in it for the money. They felt the ease of reproduction and distribution allowed them to share software with friends and fellow computer enthusiasts. Gates thought differently. He saw the free distribution of software as stealing, especially when it involved software that was created to be sold.\n",
            "In February 1976, Gates wrote an open letter to computer hobbyists, saying that continued distribution and use of software without paying for it would \"prevent good software from being written.\" In essence, pirating software would discourage developers from investing time and money into creating quality software. The letter was unpopular with computer enthusiasts, but Gates stuck to his beliefs and would use the threat of innovation as a defense when faced with charges of unfair business practices.\n",
            "Gates had an acrimonious relationship with MITS president Ed Roberts, often resulting in shouting matches. The combative Gates clashed with Roberts on software development and the direction of the business. Roberts considered Gates spoiled and obnoxious.\n",
            "In 1977, Roberts sold MITS to another computer company and went back to Georgia to enter medical school and become a doctor.\n",
            "Gates and Allen were on their own. The pair had to sue the new owner of MITS to retain the software rights they had developed for Altair. Microsoft wrote software in different formats for other computer companies, and, at the beginning of 1979, Gates moved the company's operations to Bellevue, Washington, just east of Seattle.\n",
            "Gates was glad to be home again in the Pacific Northwest and threw himself into his work. All 25 employees of the young company had broad responsibilities for all aspects of the operation, product development, business development and marketing.\n",
            "Although the company started out on shaky footing, by 1979 Microsoft was grossing approximately $2.5 million. At the age of 23, Gates placed himself as the head of the company. With his acumen for software development and a keen business sense, he led the company and worked as its spokesperson. Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, often rewriting code himself when he saw it necessary.\n",
            "DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S BILL GATES FACT CARD\n",
            "Microsoft’s Software for IBM PCs\n",
            "As the computer industry grew, with companies like Apple, Intel and IBM developing hardware and components, Gates was continuously on the road touting the merits of Microsoft software applications. He often took his mother with him. Mary was highly respected and well connected with her membership on several corporate boards, including IBM's. It was through Mary that Gates met the CEO of IBM.\n",
            "In November 1980, IBM was looking for software that would operate their upcoming personal computer (PC) and approached Microsoft. Legend has it that at the first meeting with Gates someone at IBM mistook him for an office assistant and asked him to serve coffee.\n",
            "Gates did look very young, but he quickly impressed IBM, convincing them that he and his company could meet their needs. The only problem was that Microsoft had not developed the basic operating system that would run IBM's new computers.\n",
            "Not to be stopped, Gates bought an operating system that was developed to run on computers similar to IBM's PC. He made a deal with the software's developer, making Microsoft the exclusive licensing agent and later full owner of the software but not telling them of the IBM deal.\n",
            "The company later sued Microsoft and Gates for withholding important information. Microsoft settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, but neither Gates nor Microsoft admitted to any wrongdoing.\n",
            "Gates had to adapt the newly purchased software to work for the IBM PC. He delivered it for a $50,000 fee, the same price he had paid for the software in its original form. IBM wanted to buy the source code, which would have given them the information to the operating system.\n",
            "Gates refused, instead proposing that IBM pay a licensing fee for copies of the software sold with their computers. Doing this allowed Microsoft to license the software they called MS-DOS to any other PC manufacturer, should other computer companies clone the IBM PC, which they soon did. Microsoft also released software called Softcard, which allowed Microsoft BASIC to operate on Apple II machines.\n",
            "Following the development of software for IBM, between 1979 and 1981 Microsoft's growth exploded. Staff increased from 25 to 128, and revenue shot up from $2.5 million to $16 million. In mid-1981, Gates and Allen incorporated Microsoft, and Gates was appointed president and chairman of the board. Allen was named executive vice president.\n",
            "By 1983, Microsoft was going global with offices in Great Britain and Japan. An estimated 30 percent of the world's computers ran on its software.\n",
            "Rivalry With Steve Jobs\n",
            "Though their rivalry is legend, Microsoft and Apple shared many of their early innovations. In 1981, Apple, at the time led by Steve Jobs, invited Microsoft to help develop software for Macintosh computers. Some developers were involved in both Microsoft development and the development of Microsoft applications for Macintosh. The collaboration could be seen in some shared names between the Microsoft and Macintosh systems.\n",
            "It was through this knowledge sharing that Microsoft developed Windows, a system that used a mouse to drive a graphic interface, displaying text and images on the screen. This differed greatly from the text-and-keyboard driven MS-DOS system where all text formatting showed on the screen as code and not what actually would be printed.\n",
            "Gates quickly recognized the threat this kind of software might pose for MS-DOS and Microsoft overall. For the unsophisticated user—which was most of the buying public—the graphic imagery of the competing VisiCorp software used in a Macintosh system would be so much easier to use.\n",
            "Gates announced in an advertising campaign that a new Microsoft operating system was about to be developed that would use a graphic interface. It was to be called \"Windows,\" and would be compatible with all PC software products developed on the MS-DOS system. The announcement was a bluff, in that Microsoft had no such program under development.\n",
            "As a marketing tactic, it was sheer genius. Nearly 30 percent of the computer market was using the MS-DOS system and would wait for Windows software rather than change to a new system. Without people willing to change formats, software developers were unwilling to write programs for the VisiCorp system and it lost momentum by early 1985.\n",
            "In November 1985, nearly two years after his announcement, Gates and Microsoft launched Windows. Visually the Windows system looked very similar to the Macintosh system Apple Computer Corporation had introduced nearly two years earlier.\n",
            "Apple had previously given Microsoft full access to their technology while it was working on making Microsoft products compatible for Apple computers. Gates had advised Apple to license their software but they ignored the advice, being more interested in selling computers.\n",
            "Once again, Gates took full advantage of the situation and created a software format that was strikingly similar to the Macintosh. Apple threatened to sue, and Microsoft retaliated, saying it would delay shipment of its Microsoft-compatible software for Macintosh users.\n",
            "In the end, Microsoft prevailed in the courts. It could prove that while there were similarities in how the two software systems operated, each individual function was distinctly different.\n",
            "A Competitive Reputation\n",
            "Despite the success of Microsoft, Gates never felt totally secure. Always checking on the competition over his shoulder, Gates developed a white-hot drive and competitive spirit. Gates' assistant reported coming to work early to find someone sleeping under a desk. She considered calling security or the police until she discovered it was Gates.\n",
            "Gates' intelligence allowed him to see all sides of the software industry, from product development to corporate strategy. When analyzing any corporate move, he developed a profile of all the possible cases and run through them, asking questions about anything that could possibly happen.\n",
            "He expected everyone in the company to have the same dedication. His confrontational management style became legend, as he would challenge employees and their ideas to keep the creative process going. An unprepared presenter could hear, \"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!\" from Gates.\n",
            "This was as much a test of the rigor of the employee as it was Gates' passion for his company. He was constantly checking to see if the people around him were really convinced of their ideas.\n",
            "Microsoft Office and Anti-Competition Lawsuits\n",
            "Outside the company, Gates was gaining a reputation as a ruthless competitor. Several tech companies, led by IBM, began to develop their own operating system, called OS/2, to replace MS-DOS. Rather than give in to the pressure, Gates pushed ahead with the Windows software, improving its operation and expanding its uses.\n",
            "In 1989, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Office, which bundled office productivity applications such as Microsoft Word and Excel into one system that was compatible with all Microsoft products.\n",
            "The applications were not as easily compatible with OS/2. Microsoft's new version of Windows sold 100,000 copies in just two weeks, and OS/2 soon faded away. This left Microsoft with a virtual monopoly on operating systems for PCs. Soon the Federal Trade Commission began to investigate Microsoft for unfair marketing practices.\n",
            "Throughout the 1990s, Microsoft faced a string of Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department investigations. Some related allegations that Microsoft made unfair deals with computer manufacturers who installed the Windows operating system on their computers. Other charges involved Microsoft forcing computer manufacturers to sell Microsoft's Internet Explorer as a condition for selling the Windows operating system with their computers.\n",
            "At one point, Microsoft faced a possible breakup of its two divisions — operating systems and software development. Microsoft defended itself, harking back to Gates' earlier battles with software piracy and proclaiming that such restrictions were a threat to innovation. Eventually, Microsoft was able to find a settlement with the federal government to avoid a breakup.\n",
            "Through it all, Gates found inventive ways to deflect the pressure with lighthearted commercials and public appearances at computer trade shows during which he posed as Star Trek's Mr. Spock. Gates continued to run the company and weather the federal investigations through the 1990s.\n",
            "Leaving Microsoft\n",
            "In 2000, Gates stepped down from the day-to-day operations of Microsoft, turning over the job of CEO to college friend Steve Ballmer, who had been with Microsoft since 1980. Gates positioned himself as chief software architect so he could concentrate on what was for him the more passionate side of the business, though he remained chairman of the board.\n",
            "In 2006, Gates announced he was transitioning himself from full-time work at Microsoft to devote more quality time to the foundation. His last full day at Microsoft was June 27, 2008.\n",
            "In February 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in order to move into a new position as technology adviser. Longtime Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was replaced by 46-year-old Satya Nadella.\n",
            "Personal Life\n",
            "In 1987, a 23-year-old Microsoft product manager named Melinda French caught the eye of Gates, then 32. The very bright and organized Melinda was a perfect match for Gates. In time, their relationship grew as they discovered an intimate and intellectual connection. On January 1, 1994, Melinda and Gates were married in Hawaii.\n",
            "Following the devastating death of his mother to breast cancer just a few months after their wedding, they took some time off in 1995 to travel and get a new perspective on life and the world. In 1996, their first daughter, Jennifer, was born. Their son, Rory, was born in 1999, and a second daughter, Phoebe, arrived in 2002.\n",
            "The pair announced the end of their marriage in May 2021.\n",
            "Personal Wealth\n",
            "In March 1986, Gates took Microsoft public with an initial public offering (IPO) of $21 per share, making him an instant millionaire at age 31. Gates held 45 percent of the company's 24.7 million shares, making his stake at that time $234 million of Microsoft's $520 million.\n",
            "Over time, the company's stock increased in value and split numerous times. In 1987, Gates became a billionaire when the stock hit $90.75 a share. Since then, Gates has been at the top, or at least near the top, of Forbes' annual list of the top 400 wealthiest people in America. In 1999, with stock prices at an all-time high and the stock splitting eight-fold since its IPO, Gates' wealth briefly topped $101 billion.\n",
            "Home\n",
            "In 1997, Gates and his family moved into a 55,000-square-foot house on the shore of Lake Washington. Though the house serves as a business center, it is said to be very cozy for the couple and their three children.\n",
            "The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\n",
            "In 1994, Bill and Melinda established the William H. Gates Foundation, which was dedicated to supporting education, world health and investment in low-income communities around the world. The organization also tackles domestic issues, such as helping students in the United States become college-ready.\n",
            "With Melinda's influence, Bill had taken an interest in becoming a civic leader in the footsteps of his mother, studying the philanthropic work of American industrial titans Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. He realized that he had an obligation to give more of his wealth to charity.\n",
            "In 2000, the couple combined several family foundations and made a $28 billion contribution to form the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Over the next few years, Bill’s involvement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation occupied much of his time and even more of his interest.\n",
            "Since stepping down from Microsoft, Gates devotes much of his time and energy to the work of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2015, Gates spoke out in favor of national Common Core standards in grades K through 12 and charter schools. Gates also proved to be a groundbreaking employer when, around this time, the foundation announced that it would give its employees a year's paid leave after the birth or adoption of a child.\n",
            "In 2017, the foundation launched the first of what was to become its annual \"Goalkeepers\" report, an examination of progress made in several important areas related to public health, including child mortality, malnutrition and HIV. At the time, Gates identified infectious and chronic disease as the two biggest public health concerns that needed to be addressed over the coming decade.\n",
            "In April 2018, Gates announced that he was teaming with Google co-founder Larry Page to provide $12 million in funding for a universal flu vaccine. He said the funds would be awarded in grants of up to $2 million for individual efforts that are \"bold and innovative,\" aiming to begin clinical trials by 2021. Although some questioned whether $12 million would be enough to spark any real medical breakthrough, others praised the intentions behind the investment, while Gates indicated that there could be more to come.\n",
            "Alzheimer's Research\n",
            "Gates revealed in November 2017 that he was investing $50 million of his own money into the Dementia Discovery Fund. He would follow with another $50 million toward start-up ventures working in Alzheimer’s research. It was said to be a personal matter for Gates, who has seen the devastating effects of the disease on his own family members.\n",
            "\"Any type of treatment would be a huge advance from where we are today,\" he told CNN, adding, \"the long-term goal has got to be cure.\"\n",
            "Building a 'Smart City' in Arizona\n",
            "In 2017, it was revealed that one of Gates's firms had invested $80 million into the development of a \"smart city\" near Phoenix, Arizona.

            " Club of world’s 10 richest people finally gets a member from Asia\n",
            "Asia’s richest man has entered a new league of wealth.\n",
            "The net worth of Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd., has jumped to $64.5 billion, making him the only Asian tycoon in the exclusive club of the world’s top 10 richest people, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He overtook Larry Ellison of Oracle Corp. and France’s Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, the wealthiest woman, to reach the No. 9 spot.\n",
            "Ambani, who owns 42% of Reliance, has benefited from a flurry of investment into the company’s digital unit, Jio Platforms Ltd., that Reliance said has made it net-debt free ahead of a March 2021 target. The shares of the Indian conglomerate have doubled from a low in March, just as other billionaires on the list have been hit by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
            "While the Indian economy “has been nearly decimated” during the lockdown to control the spread of Covid-19, “Mr. Ambani’s companies (particularly the telecom giant Jio) have prospered, and his personal wealth has increased substantially,” said Jayati Ghosh, chair of the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at the Jawaharlal Nehru University.\n",
            "A media representative for Reliance declined to comment on Ambani’s fortune.\n",
            "Economic Divide\n",
            "The rise of the 63-year-old as India heads for its worst-ever recession is a reminder of the nation’s deep economic divide, in which the top 10% hold more than three-quarters of the total wealth, and where most new fortune creation stays in the hands of the richest 1%. Ambani lives in a 27-story mansion in Mumbai, known as Antilia, that has three rooftop helipads, parking for 168 cars, a 50-seat movie theater, a grand ballroom with crystal chandeliers, three floors of Babylon-inspired hanging gardens, a yoga studio, and a health spa and fitness center.\n",
            "While a crash in oil prices caused uncertainty in a stake sale of Reliance’s oil and chemicals division, in just two months Jio managed to attract some $15 billion — more than half the investment into telecom companies worldwide this year. Facebook Inc., General Atlantic, Silver Lake Partners, KKR & Co. and Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund are among those trying to get a slice of one of the world’s fastest-growing online commerce markets. A June report by Sanford C. Bernstein predicted that Jio is likely to capture 48% of India’s mobile subscriber market share by 2025.\n",
            "In the latest potential deal slated to bolster Ambani’s e-commerce ambitions, Reliance is close to acquiring stakes in some units of Future Group, which already has a partnership with Amazon.com Inc., people familiar with the matter have said.\n",
            "Ambani got his start in the family’s business in the early 1980s, when his father, Dhirubhai Ambani, summoned him back to India to oversee construction of a polyester mill after a year at Stanford Business School. The Ambanis began to buy up suppliers as well as petrochemical plants and oil refineries and eventually built the company into a fabrics, textiles and energy empire. Dhirubhai died of a stroke in 2002 without leaving a will, triggering a feud between Mukesh and his brother, Anil.\n",
            "In a settlement brokered by their mother, the brothers split the family business. Mukesh retained control over the refining, petrochemicals, oil and gas, and textiles operations, while Anil took the telecommunications, asset-management, entertainment and power-generation businesses. In 2013, the brothers announced a $220 million pact to share a fiber-optic network, their first deal since splitting the Reliance empire. Parts of Anil’s operations have since struggled, with a unit of his Reliance Communications Ltd. filing for bankruptcy last year.\n",
            "Mukesh revels in being the biggest. In India, Reliance officially became just that last year, when it surpassed state-owned Indian Oil Corp. to become the country’s largest company by revenue. At Reliance’s annual shareholder meeting in August, which is covered like a national event — including by its media and entertainment arm, Network18 — Ambani called it the “golden decade of Reliance.” He celebrated the group’s growing list of superlatives: the largest telecom enterprise by subscribers, revenues and profit; a retail arm larger than all other major retailers combined; an oil giant that makes India’s largest export.\n",
            "“We are also incubating newer growth engines,” Ambani said at the time, adding that he hoped the digital-driven expansion could be more inclusive. “No power on earth can stop India from rising higher.”\n",
            "At least on the global wealth ranking, that seems to be the case.\n",

As a result, the chairman of Reliance Industries saw his net worth climb to $92.7 billion (₹6,95,200 crore).In June, the inveterate entrepreneur also unveiled his next growth engine in the green energy space. On the anvil are plans to build four gigafactories in Jamnagar. In addition, Reliance also plans to construct a solar photovoltaic module factory that would convert raw silica into polysilicon and then to wafers. Ambani plans to invest a total of ₹75,000 crore in the green energy space, although details of what the amount will be spent on remain sketchy. \n",

            "Reliance’s valuation is a mix of the legacy hydrocarbons business and the higher terminal values that investors have been ascribing to retail and telecom. Over the last year, there has been a steady stream of news in both these businesses, which has resulted in investors ascribing FAANG-like valuations to the business. As it gets more conscious on the ESG scale, expect Reliance to attract more investments from ESG funds. In the retail space, there is the impending buyout of Future Retail, which would give the company an unassailable lead in India’s rapidly evolving retail landscape. JioMart, its delivery service, competes against Amazon, Flipkart and BigBasket, giving it a toehold in the grocery delivery market that is expected to grow at 25-30 percent a year for the next decade. “They seem to be making the right moves,” says Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market expert. He cites the recent decision to partner with 7-Eleven for a network of neighbourhood stores challenging kiranas. As it prepares to build out these businesses, RIL raised ₹47,265 crore by selling a 10.09 percent stake in Reliance Retail Ventures to a clutch to investors (Silver Lake, KKR and Mubadala, among others) in 2020. The stake sales in both retail and telecom, where it raised ₹199,320 crore, have transformed RIL’s balance sheet and positioned it for the next leg of growth. Borrowings are down from ₹355,000 crore in March 2020 to ₹270,000 in March 2021, making it a net zero debt company. Apart from green energy, Jio promises to be another significant investment area on Ambani’s to-do list. It now has the advantage of being the largest carrier by subscribers in a consolidated three-player (plus BSNL) market. The industry has fought a debilitating price war since 2016 when Jio first launched its services. Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) has trended down, while capital expenditures for licence fees and network rollouts and interest payments have risen. There are now signs that the industry should once again see ARPUs trend upwards, although estimates on how high they could go vary widely. Jio has seen its ARPUs move from ₹145 to ₹143.6 in the year ended September 30, 2021. It is now putting in place plans to take its lead in telecom to build moats around a variety of businesses, from entertainment to smart homes and e-shopping to telemedicine. There is also the impending launch of a smartphone in partnership with Google that could lock in value conscious subscribers.Lastly, there’s the legacy hydrocarbons business where Saudi Aramco has been brought in as a partner with a $15 billion (₹1,12,500 crore) investment. While due diligence on that investment is pending and the fate of the deal is unknown, the business holds promise as Ambani plans to convert it into an oil to chemicals play. Its refined petrochemical products form the feedstock for a host of specialty chemicals and once the company announces the products it plans to manufacture the market could re-rate that business as well. For now, Reliance Industries is still priced using a sum of the parts valuation metric. While the legacy hydrocarbons business is a drag, the new age telecom and retail businesses have been ascribed higher terminal values by the market. At a market cap of ₹17,21,000 crore, it has surpassed rival Tata Consultancy Services valued at ₹13,33,000 crore. The stock trades at about 30 times FY22 earnings and a return on equity of 8 percent.Baliga, the independent market analyst, says that the company has a good story to sell, but is cautions that it would be imprudent to extrapolate current valuations too much into the future. “This is a market where every (story) is selling,” he says, while agreeing that RIL has a lot going for it. Still, a rise in interest rates could result in valuations compressing. It is hard to see Ambani relinquishing his number one status on the Rich List any time soon. Over the next 18 months, expect Ambani to unveil further value-unlocking steps in his empire. Independent market flotations of the retail and telecom ventures are almost certain. Investors could be brought in to finance RIL’s green energy bets, marki an end to RIL’s decade-long investment cycle. Investors who have been so far patient may be rewarded with higher dividend payouts. \n",

            "Table of Contents\n",
            "What is Mukesh Ambani's Net Worth?\n",
            "\n",
            "Mukesh Ambani is an Indian businessman who has a net worth of $108 billion. Mukesh Ambani spent much of the last 10+ years as the richest person in India. Mukesh is the chairman and largest shareholder of Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL), a Fortune Global 500 company and India's most valuable company by market value. His journey to becoming one of the world's wealthiest individuals is a tale of strategic foresight, innovation, and expansion.\n",
            "Ambani's career began under the tutelage of his father, Dhirubhai Ambani, who founded Reliance Industries. Initially, the company was focused on textiles and polyester, but Mukesh played a pivotal role in diversifying its business portfolio. Under his leadership, Reliance ventured into refining, petrochemicals, and oil & gas exploration, which significantly boosted its revenues and market presence.\n",
            "One of the most notable milestones in Ambani's career was the establishment of Reliance Communications Limited in 2002. This marked the group's foray into the telecommunications sector, which would later become a major revenue generator for the conglomerate. However, his most significant achievement in this domain came years later with the launch of Jio in 2016. Jio revolutionized the Indian telecom sector by offering affordable 4G services, rapidly gaining a massive customer base, and reshaping the market dynamics.\n",
            "Mukesh Ambani's strategy has always been centered around large-scale investments, technological innovation, and an aggressive market penetration approach. This was evident in his investment in the Jamnagar Refinery, one of the world's largest refining hubs, which significantly amplified Reliance's capabilities in the petrochemical sector.\n",
            "Furthermore, under Ambani's guidance, Reliance has ventured into retail with Reliance Retail and digital services, creating a more diversified business model. His vision for the digital space has attracted significant global investments, including partnerships with prominent tech giants.\n",
            "MANPREET ROMANA/AFP via Getty Images\n",
            "Early Life\n",
            "Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani was born on April 19, 1957, in the British Crown colony of Aden, what is present-day Yemen. He has a younger brother and two sisters. In 1958, the family moved back to India, where his father started a trading business in spices and textiles in Mumbai.\n",
            "He attended the Hill Grange High School in Mumbai and received a Bachelor's in Engineering degree in Chemical Engineering from the Institute of Chemical Technology (formerly the University Department of Chemical Technology).\n",
            "Career with Reliance Industries\n",
            "In 1980, the Indian government opened up polyester filament yarn (PFY) manufacturing to the private sector, and Ambani's father applied for a license to set up a PFY manufacturing plant, beating out competition from over forty other enterprises to receive the license. Ambani, the eldest son of the family, was pulled out of his MBA program at Stanford by his father—who valued real-life experience over classroom learning—to help build the PFY plant. Following executive director Rasikbhai Meswani's death and his father's stroke in 1986, responsibility for the company shifted to Ambani and his brother Anil.\n",
            "He set up Reliance Infocomm Limited, now Reliance Communications Limited, which focused on information and communications technology (ICT) initiatives. At the age of 24, Ambani was also put in charge of the construction of the Patalganga petrochemical plant as the company began heavily investing in oil refineries and petrochemicals.\n",
            "Following their father's death in 2002 after suffering a second stroke, the lack of a will detailing the distribution of the family's business empire led to a feud between Ambani and his brother Anil. Their mother intervened, splitting the company into two. Ambani received control of Reliance Industries Limited and Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited in a move approved of by the Bombay High Court in December 2005. After the split of the business in 2010, Ambani directed and created the world's largest grassroots petroleum refinery at Jamnagar, India, which had the capacity to produce 660,000 barrels per day or 33 million tonnes per year.\n",
            "He continued the expansion of his empire with multiple ventures and partnerships. He became heavily involved in the move towards 4G in India, having announced in 2013 the possibility of a collaborative venture with Bharti Airtel in setting up digital infrastructure for India's 4G network. He then said in 2014 that he would invest Rs 1.8 trillion across businesses over the next three years, with plans to launch 4G broadband services in 2015. Reliance's Jio, also led by Ambani, launched its own 4G smartphone brand, \"LYF,\" in February 2016, which became India's third-largest-selling mobile phone brand in June 2016. Reliance Retail Ltd., another subsidiary of Reliance, is the largest retailer in India.\n",
            "Ambani was ranked as the 5th-best performing global CEO by the Harvard Business Review in 2010. Through the various Reliance ventures that he has headed, he has built up a large personal net worth. Bloomberg's \"Robin Hood Index\" estimated in February 2018 that Ambani's personal wealth at the time was enough to fund the full operations of the Indian federal government for 20 days. He has consistently held the title of India's richest person for the last decade. He surpassed Jack Ma, the executive chairman of Alibaba Group, to become Asia's richest person in July 2018.\n",
            "CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images\n",
            "Criminal Offense Allegations\n",
            "A First Information Report alleging criminal offenses was filed against Ambani in February 2014. The report alleges irregularities in the pricing of natural gas from the KG Basin.\n",
            "Other Ventures and Activities\n",
            "In 2008, Ambani received the title of \"The World's Richest Sports Team Owner\" after he purchased the Indian Premier League cricket team, the Mumbai Indians, for $111.9 million. He is also the founder of the Indian Super League, a football league in India. Additionally, Ambani was the first non-American to be on the Bank of America's board and is also Former Director of the bank. He also serves as President of Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University, Gandhinagar, Gujarat.\n",
            "Personal life\n",
            "Ambani married Nita Ambani in 1985, after his father attended a dance performance, which Nita took part in, and decided to arrange a marriage between them. Together, the couple have two sons and a daughter.\n",
            "In 2007, Ambani gifted his wife a $60 million Airbus A319 for her 44th birthday. The Airbus features custom fittings for a living room, bedroom, satellite television, WiFi, sky bar, Jacuzzi, and office, and can carry 180 passengers.\n",
            "He has received many awards, including the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award (2000), the Financial Chronicle's Businessman of the Year Award (2010), the Business Council for International Understanding's Global Leadership Award (2010), and the Chemical Heritage Foundation's Othmer Gold Medal (2016). Additionally, he has an honorary Doctorate of Science from the M.S. University of Baroda.\n",
            "Mumbai Mansion \"Antilia\"\n",
            "Mukesh and his family reside in Antilia, a private 27-storey building in Mumbai that is valued at over $1 billion. He reportedly spent $1 billion of his personal funds on the building's construction. The complex is so large it requires a staff of 600 to oversee and maintain its various amenities, including three helipads, a 160-car garage, a private movie theater, a swimming pool, and fitness center:\n",

He attended Lakeside School, an exclusive private school in Seattle, where he met his future business partner, Paul Allen. Gates scored 1590 out of 1600 on the SAT and enrolled at Harvard University in 1973, but he didn't stay for long.

The company's big break came in 1980 when IBM approached Microsoft to create an operating system for its new personal computer. Gates and his team developed the OS, which they called MS-DOS, and licensed it to IBM. The success of MS-DOS propelled Microsoft to the forefront of the burgeoning personal computer industry.\n",
